This test is to check the performance of the system when multiple Users are reading simultaneously from the same file.

1)Create multiple users
2)Create a file and have all the users perform read on the same file.
3)Run the same tests for the following number of users: 1 user, 10 users, 20 users, 30 users, 40 users, 50 users, 60 users
3)After each iteration (iteration of 1 user, 10 users, ...) plot the time required by the set of users to read from the same file.

Expected result: Since each user is granted read lease immediately for reading on the same file, the time required to perform read
                 shouldn't be too high and should increase linearly with the number of users.
