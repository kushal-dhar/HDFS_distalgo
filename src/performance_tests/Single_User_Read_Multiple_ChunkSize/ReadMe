This test is done with single user with multiple chunk sizes to identify how
chunk sizes determine the read time.

1)Create the user.
2)Create a file and write some content into it
3)Make multiple read requests of different sizes from a user for a fixed chunk size
4)Repeat the expermiment with a different chunk size.

Expected result : To read large files, bigger chunk sizes should be used
as otherwise cient has to send multiple read request and has to await on each
read result.
