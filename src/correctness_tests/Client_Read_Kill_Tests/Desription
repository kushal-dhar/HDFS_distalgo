This is a test to check what happens when a user is killed while reading, while other users are performing read/writes

1.Create a file f1
2.Write some content into it
3.Out of all the users, we randomly select one of the user to be killed
4.If a user is selected to be killed, he will be killed without calling close

Expected output: The filesystem will carry out operations as intended and all the other users end up completing their operations.
