Checks the following scenario for datanode failure:

1) Write data to a file
2) Read data from the file
- Assert that the read data is same as written data
3) Kill two datanodes out of 3
4) Allow namenode to detect the failure of these 2 failed datanodes
5) Try to read the file
- It will fail with high probability and succeed with a small probability
6) Resurrect one of the failed datanode
7) Allow namenode to re-register this newly resurrected datanode
8) Read the data from file again
- Assert that the read data is same as written data
