Checks the following scenario for datanode failure:

1) Write data to a file
2) Read data from the file
- Assert that the read data is same as written data
3) Kill one datanodes out of 3
4) Allow namenode to detect the failure of this failed datanode
5) Read the data from file again
- Assert that the read data is same as written data
