This check is to test the handling of concurrent wrie requests

1)Create a few Users
2)Create a file f1 and make all the users write on the same file
3) Every user writes a number multiple times. The reason for this is, in the expected output should have all the occurences of the number grouped together

Expected result: A string of numbers with all the occurences of a number grouped together to ensure two writes did not overlap
