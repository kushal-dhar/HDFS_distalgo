This is the test case for basic file operations
Checks the following file operations from a single user:

1) Create a file
2) List files
- Created file should show in the list of files
2) Read data from the file
- Assert that the read data is same as written data
3) Append data to the file
4) Open file for read
- Assert that the file eventually is open for reading
5) Try to read the file
- Assert that the read data is same as written data
6) Close file
7) Open a file which does not exist
- Assert that it is not possible to open a file which is not created
